# SBA-Loan-Approval-and-Data-Visualization
SBA provides loan to small businesses acting as a guarantee to the lending Bank.

This project trains a ML model on a real world SBA loan data and predicts a successful loan using Random forest classifier.

Another model trained on the data is Logistic Regression.

Since, The cost of false Positive > Cost of False negative in this problem domain, the models were selected based on their precision score.


Precision on logistic regression was 84% while with random forest classifier was 94%.

The insights are visualized using Power BI.
